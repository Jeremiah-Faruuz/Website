        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Jake Faruuz and I am a student at a university, and my favourite fruit, as you guessed it, is a banana. I love bananas because it’s sweet, soft, healthy, and a nice snack. I am interested in the overripe bananas because a lot of people just throw them away, and waste what’s not actually a waste. There is many filths and dirt in our world, and I wanted to alleviate some of that from our beautiful Earth with my journey on eating bananas. I believe the little things matter a lot more than people realize.
